## **Description**

  The goal of this project was to create a ReadMe.md generator using Node.js and the command line. This was my first project using Node.js and no html or css.   This required the use of a NPM package - inquirer.  
Additionally, I used an additional NPM package - inquirer-loop which allowed me to loop my questions depending on user input.  
This project is executed solely in the command line interface so no HTML or CSS was used.  The ultimate output is a readme file.
.

## **Installation**

1) Install Node.js
2) Install NPM inquirer
3) Install NPM inquirer-loop


## **Usage** 

Users can use this ReadMe generator to create complete and consistent ReadMe documents for all their projects.     A user only needs to follow the prompts to complete their ReadMe.  When prompted to enter a description of the project, the userâ€™s default text editor will be initialized.  Please enter the description of the project in the text editor. Once completed, save and exit.  The contents from the text editor will be saved in the command line.
