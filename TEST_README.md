## **Contributing**


Getting started

Check to see below for the types of contributions we accept before making changes. Some of them don't even require writing a single line of code.

Issues
Create a new issue
If you spot a problem with the docs, search if an issue already exists. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant issue form.

Solve an issue
Scan through our existing issues to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using labels as filters. See Labels for more information. As a general rule, we do not assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

Make Changes
Make changes in the UI

Click Make a contribution at the bottom of any docs page to make small changes such as a typo, sentence fix, or a broken link. This takes you to the .md file where you can make your changes and create a pull request for a review.

Make changes in a codespace
For more information about using a codespace for working on GitHub documentation, see "Working in a codespace."

Make changes locally
Fork the repository.

Using GitHub Desktop:

Getting started with GitHub Desktop will guide you through setting up Desktop.
Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to fork the repo!
U
sing the command line:

Fork the repo so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.
Install or update to Node.js v16. For more information, see the development guide.

Create a working branch and start with your changes!

Commit your update
Commit the changes once you are happy with them. Don't forget to self-review to speed up the review processâš¡.

Pull Request
When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.

Don't forget to link PR to issue if you are solving one.

Enable the checkbox to allow maintainer edits so the branch can be updated for a merge. Once you submit your PR, a Docs team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.

We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using suggested changes or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as resolved.
If you run into any merge issues, checkout this git tutorial to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.
Your PR is merged!

Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be publicly visible on the GitHub docs.

Now that you are part of the GitHub docs community, see how else you can contribute to the docs.
